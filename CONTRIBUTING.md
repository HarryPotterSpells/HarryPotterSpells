# HarryPotterSpells - Contributing #
So you want to help code for HarryPotterSpells? That's great. Our respect for you has just improved greatly. Thank you.

We aren't as strict as some people when it comes to adding stuff to the code but there are a few basic guides you should follow. Each of the guides below corresponds to a different addition. Also make sure you test every single code you add! If you don't have the power to test then ask someone else to.

Remember what Zephos said when reading these guides:
> Guidelines are just rules and rules are meant to be broken so guidelines are meant to be ignored.
